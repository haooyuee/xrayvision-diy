# Chest X-ray Image Analysis

In this project, we trained multi-class classification models on the NIH dataset to diagnose different diseases. We first built models based on different neural network architectures (ResNet, DenseNet, EfficientNetV2), and then tried some different optimization algorithms to improve model performance.

## Baseline models
- ResNet50
- DenseNet101
- EfficientNetV2-s
### Model performance

## AUCM MultiLabel loss function

## Non-local module

## Label smoothing

## Model ensembling

## Conclusion
